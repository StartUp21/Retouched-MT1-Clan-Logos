# Retouched MT1 Clan Logos
The MT1 clans' logos are rather simple in design compared to the MT2 clans'. This mildly annoys me because they look lopsided when paired together in the game. So, I've taken some time to retouch the old clans' logos to fit more with the new clans.

Rest assured, I didn't just pull these logos out of my ass. They're based on the DETAILED clan logos that already exist, you can see them on the respective clan's Tome. I did take some liberties with some of these, but the core idea remains the same.

Currently, the new logos should apply to everywhere but the unit banners on the OVERWORLD map during a run.

## Patch Notes
1.0: Released
(If things go well, I'll attempt to edit the new logos into the unit banners as well. This will take some time.)
